# ovh-python-email-manager
Simple command line program to manage OVH shared hosting email accounts.

I created this program because when I changed hosting to OVH I needed to create like 80 mailboxes and I didn't want to do it manually. 

Basically you can use the provided command line program as usual, just check the help:
```
python ovh_emails.py -h
```
or even 
```
chmod u+x ovh_emails.py
./ovh_emails.py -h
```
